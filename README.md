BANK ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The Bank Account Management System is a Python-based application that simulates banking operations such as account creation, balance inquiry, deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, and modifications to customer details. It follows an object-oriented approach (OOP), using a class Sbi to model a real-world banking system.

Features
1.Account Creation:
Users can create an account with details like name, phone number, age, Aadhaar, address, PIN, and an initial balance. The system automatically assigns a unique Account Number.

2.Balance Inquiry:
Users can check their current account balance by entering their account number and PIN.

3.Deposit Money:
Allows users to deposit money into their account. Updates the balance and stores transaction details.

4.Withdraw Money:
Users can withdraw money from their account. Ensures PIN authentication and sufficient balance before processing.

5.Fund Transfer:
Users can transfer money to another valid account within the system. Requires the recipient's account number and IFSC code for verification.

6.Modify Customer Details:
Users can update their name, phone number, or address. PIN modification is also allowed with authentication.

7.Transaction History (Mini Statement):
Users can view a mini statement of their last transactions. Displays transaction type (credit/debit), amount, balance, and timestamp.

8.Validation Checks:
Phone number, Aadhaar, PIN, and other inputs are validated to maintain security. Ensures PIN is 4 digits, Aadhaar is 12 digits, and phone number is 10 digits.
